                Hi there! My name is Ivan Benedictus Halim. 
                I was born in Jakarta, 06 December 1999. 
                Growing up, I always had a passion for learning and sharing my projects with other people, especially about business, technology, and its applications. 
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                One aspect of business that interests me is how each company makes its decisions to ensure growth in the future. 
                That's when I found the Data Analyst / Data Scientist role. 
                My goal is to contribute to the company's growth and expansion by evaluating market trends, assessing the competitive landscape, and recommending strategies to improve the company's performance.
                
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                As a Data Analyst, We can learn a lot from a single piece of data. 
                But sometimes, some of the data might also contain misleading informations that could be dangerous for the company. 
                That's why, on this website, I'm going to show you the process of how I prepare, process, and present my data using Python and Tableau.

            </div>
            <p class="explanation">
                To clean this data, I first checked the summary of the data frame.
                Usually, I checked the total number of data, the null values, and the range of the data (min and max) and looked for anything suspicious.
                As we can see, the data has the same count values on each column, which means there shouldn't be any null values inside the data.
                But when I investigated further, I saw the max values at some columns are way bigger than their mean value, which indicates that there might be some inaccurate data (or an outlier).

            <p class="explanation">
                I then checked the data once again to make sure there weren't any null values inside the data.
                If there are some null values, I usually delete those values or assign the mean value as the new value.
                Right now, the output doesn't show any null values, which indicates there are none.

                Next, I checked for duplicate values on the data frame and showed the result in the table below.
                If there are any duplicate values, I usually remove those data from the dataset. 
                Right now, the output doesn't show any duplicate values, which indicates that there are none.

            <p class="explanation">
                In this step, I checked for any suspicious data from the summary I had analyzed before (max values).
                If there were any suspicious values, they were most likely incorrectly input by the user.
                But for this one, I think the location "Indonesia" indicates the total of all the cases that happened that day.
                To deal with this issue, I removed all the data that contained the word "Indonesia" from the Location column.

                One thing that usually comes to mind when exploring the data I have is to find the range of time of the data.
                To do that, we can simply find the earliest and the latest data inputted by the user using the min() and max() functions.
                For this data frame, we can conclude that this data was taken from 03 January 2020 until 15 September 2022.

                Grouping data can help you deal with continuous values.
                For instance, I make an Emergency Level column to indicate the emergency level according to daily New Cases.
                If the daily number of New Cases is under 3000, it is considered a Green Zone. 
                If the range is between 3000 - 6000, it is considered a Yellow Zone.
                If the range is between 6000 - 12000, it is considered an Orange Zone. 
                And if it's higher than 12000, it is considered a Red Zone.
                As a side note, we can also edit the range or perform more complicated calculations based on our needs.

                As a Data Analyst, the ability to communicatee our results clearly and accurately to other people, especially to our company's shareholders, has become an essential role for the job.
